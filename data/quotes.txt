In many ways, it's a dull language, borrowing solid old concepts from many other languages & styles: boring syntax, 
unsurprising semantics,
few automatic coercions, etc etc. 
But that's one of the things I like about Python
The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.
My favorite language for maintainability is Python. It has simple, clean syntax, object encapsulation, good library support, and optional named parameters.
